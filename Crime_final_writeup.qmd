## Discussion

### Proportions Alter General Linear Model Results

Another statistical model we attempted to run was the general linear model, glm. The “VIOLENT_CRIME” was the binary variable, predicted outcome, and the “report_start_diff” was matrix of predictor variables. Our glm summary, showed that the more the difference between the report and start date grew the more likely it was a nonviolent crime. We were content with our result because it confirms violent crimes are taken more seriously, yet our visualization did not portray such confidence. It depicted a negative slope, yet the S-shape curve did not form.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(car)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tseries)

# Exploring Graphs & LM, ANOVA, GLM ------------------------------------------------------------
viol_crime <- c("HOMICIDE", "SEX ABUSE", "ROBBERY", "ASSAULT W/DANGEROUS WEAPON")


# START-REPORT
report_data <- rbind(dc.data2008, dc.data2009, dc.data2010, dc.data2011, dc.data2012, dc.data2013, dc.data2014, dc.data2015, dc.data2016, dc.data2017, dc.data2018, dc.data2019, dc.data2020, dc.data2021, dc.data2022, dc.data2023)%>%
               mutate(
                      VIOLENT_CRIME = ifelse(OFFENSE %in% viol_crime, 1, 0),
                      REPORT = ymd_hms(REPORT_DAT, tz = "America/New_York"),
                      START = ymd_hms(START_DATE, tz = "America/New_York")
               )%>%
               mutate(report_start_diff = as.numeric(difftime(REPORT, START, units = "hours")),
                      ) %>%
               filter(report_start_diff >= 0 & report_start_diff< 50000) #filter outliers
```
```{r}
#GLM Plot
report_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = report_start_diff, y = VIOLENT_CRIME)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial"), se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Nonviolent and Violent Crime",
    subtitle =  "Difference Between Report and Start Date (hours) ",
    xlab = " Report Date - Start Date  ",
    ylab = "Violent Crime"
  )
glm_model <- glm(VIOLENT_CRIME ~ report_start_diff, data= report_data)
summary(glm_model)

```

After looking more into the demographics of our data, we found some streaking information. Our data was majority nonviolent crime(85% vs 15%) resulting in our model to over fit. Gathering the measures of central tendency, it appears that violent crime is most likely to be reported faster than a nonviolent crime. Yet we cannot be entirely sure because we have such a small sample size. 
####Proportion
```{r}
print(prop.table(table(report_data$VIOLENT_CRIME)) * 100 )#Proportions of Non vs Violent Crime are not equivalent Nonviolent = 84.16% & Violent =15.84%

```
```{r}
averages <- report_data %>%
  group_by(VIOLENT_CRIME) %>%
  summarise(mean_hours = mean(report_start_diff, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_hours = median(report_start_diff, na.rm = TRUE),
            min_hours = min(report_start_diff, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_hours = max(report_start_diff, na.rm = TRUE))
averages

```
